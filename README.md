___

A simplest impelementation of a social netowrk will consist of profiles with no friends, no messaging, no statuses, ... just things like 'name', 'age', 'hobbies'.  A user can see a list of profiles, click on one to read it, and return to the list of profiles.
  * Profiles in this social network are an unrelated data-type.  Each profile stands alone and has no instances of another data type associated with it.

___      
## User stories your app must satisfy:
 

A user can ...
* create profiles from the home page.
* view a list of all profiles on a home page.
* click on a profile from the list to view the entire profile.
* navigate back home from a profile's pag.
* edit a profile from the profile's page.
* delete a profile from the profile's page.
___
## Implementation:

* Your app will be run out of a single HTML page.  Navigation will be achieved by redrawing the body.
* We have provided you with specs to get started on your JS.
* Dev trick - extend the view class to work for the terminal and build test scripts that simulate a user.
    * We will go over this technique in code review.
